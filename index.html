   <h2>About Me</h2>                 
   <p> I graduated in May of 2017 from Gulf Coast High School, with the Bright Futures scholarship. I got very determined to study
       some feild of engineering early on in high school as I got involved with the engineering academy that my school provided.
       I have earned certifications in programs such as Autodesk Inventor and Microsoft office. After a lot of research I did for
       an engineering project, I decided to pursue a degree in software engineering as I quicjkly took interest in the feild and 
       what it enticed. Currently I am attending Florida Gulf Coast University and studying to obtain a degree in software 
       engineering. I have almost three years experience in retail. I'm known for having exceptional people skills and for 
       having an uncomparable work ethic. I have plenty of exerience when it comes to building computers. I have most recently 
       built a new computer for New Balance of Naples for a replacement to the old cash register. As I continue to pursue my degree 
       I become more passionate and excited for what the feild of Software engineering will bring me.</p>
