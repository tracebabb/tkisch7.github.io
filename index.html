   <h3>About Me</h3>                 
   <p1>Graduated from high school in May of 2017 after four years of hard work and determination. 
   During my years as a high schooler I played soccer for three of the four years and achieved a 
   runner-up in the state finals in 2016. Currently I am furthering my education at Florida Gulf coast University, 
   and I am  currently studying to be a software engineer.</p>
